All she represent is herself who wants a quick commission without adequate effort. Her knowledge, expertise, negotiation skills are so poor. There was a property line dispute but she told me no any problem in that property. After escrow was closed and the neighbor approached me and we found out. But even at that point, she just wanted to protect herself without providing any help to us. She never felt any sorry. Instead she pointed the finger to me and said I should review documents or contact the related persons by myself. In fact, I spent lots of hours to work on the problem.

1,"33252 Alagon St, Temecula, CA 92592",2016-05-06,"John Lewis left me in the rain literally.... I will explain exactly my first time home buyers experience.  Back in 2008 I went to look for my first new home.  You know that feeling if you bought before, and even if you had not bought you dream what the experience will be like... Like a Cinderella feeling going to a ball, the American Dream. I was a dream loan candidate no debt and a VA loan all ready so all we had to do was pick out the home.  Sadly though we wanted San Diego the town we were looking at was a bit out of our price range, but the realtor was very nice and showed us some great homes.  We were looking for a bit more for a bit less cost.  Temecula was our second choice.  We didn't have a realtor in Temecula and we saw this office.  It wasn't busy at all, no clients that we could see at the time and we were met by John Lewis.  We looked for a bit online and found a few prospects.  All were foreclosures though at the time weren't most? We looked at them in person found one that was ok and decided let's put an offer in. This is where he only has his own best interest and if your a first time home buyer he will not look out for you.  My fault for not knowing what I was getting in to buy a warning for ANY first time buyer as he will take advantage of you.He said well if you want to make an offer its good to put a little bit over asking price to let them know your a serious buyer.  He paused and said you don't know how many other people have offers on the home and you can loose it.  Back in 2008 I didn't know about Zillow or any other web based programs to show homes on the market.  John showed us his MLS but didn't show us or tell us about facts on the home.  One that it was on the market for a very long time,  almost a year.  That the price has dropped and he wants us to come in over.  Sure he does, more profit for him.Once we put in our offer over asking price he said I know you have a VA loan but let me send you to my friend she can write up a better loan for you.  Again my fault as I should have done a bit more homework. After this he was non-existent.So we bought the home, called John and asked how do we get the keys.  He stated they are at your front door just go to your new home.  It's pouring raining and we drive to the home and look everywhere for the keys.  We're soaking wet, called him again and he said they should be right there... Finally he says, I'll be there in 20 minutes I have them right here.  After making a great deal of money for just hours of work on us as a client this is how he treats us?Please if your a first time home buyer he does NOT have your best interest at heart.  I have been much wiser and met many other realtors since then that will earn their commission not try to just get a sell.  Last thing he said was if you send xxxx clients to me and they buy a home we will send you and your wife on a vacation.  Since then I had 23 other friends buy a home and I recommended 0 to John.  They all had very pleasant home buying experiences and are very happy with their purchase.  Stay clear from this place they do not have to customers interest at heart.  My first time home buying experience was a nightmare.  Every time I had a question about my purchase after I accepted the purchase he was not there for me and I had to fend for my self.  Don't use his ""friend"" who does loans either.  There are fair and good loan brokers who will tell you up front the truth.

2,"7537 El Paso St La Mesa, CA 91942",2023-01-31,"Patrick was good at facilitating a deal. He was able to open doors, setup viewings and pass information to the seller’s agent. He is good to get you through a deal if YOU find your property you want and if budget is not a factor to you. I would not recommend him if you don’t have time to find a property and need someone to fight for the property you want. My significant other and I found the bulk of the properties we toured. He provided us some properties based on our search criteria (AFTER we insisted he do it for us - as that is what realtors get paid for) and after looking at a few of them with him we opted to find them ourselves. Algorithms and search filters on Redfin and Zillow proved to be a more powerful tool than what he had to offer. When it came time to closing the deal, he fought with us (the buyer) during critical steps of the negotiation phase mentioning that the seller wouldn’t go that low, that they wouldn’t repair a roof, or whatever else that would create more friction for the seller and him. For those looking to buy a home, typically the realtor doesn’t want the price to go lower because it lowers their commission and causes them more work. After telling him to provide our information to the seller and giving him the reasons why the selling price eventually went for almost 100k less than the original purchasing price. Providing the information took a lot of due diligence from the BUYERS’ time which meant looking at comps and the details of the price of the house was not reasonable, market conditions, and calling contractors to assess the condition of the property, etc.People are busy enough with life, work, family, and activities. A realtor should be able to do the necessary leg work to find you potential homes, work to get to the price you believe in/market fit, work to get any repairs if necessary, and most importantly not add any more stress to an already stressful situation. For potential buyers in the market, find yourself a realtor that will WORK for you, not try to normalize not working.",patrick good facilitate deal able open door setup viewing pass information seller agent good deal find property want budget factor recommend time find property need fight property want significant find bulk property tour provide property base search criterion insist realtor pay look opt find algorithm search filter redfin zillow prove powerful tool offer come time close deal fight buyer critical step negotiation phase mention seller low repair roof create friction seller look buy home typically realtor want price low lower commission cause work tell provide information seller give reason selling price eventually go original purchasing price provide information take lot diligence buyer time mean look comp detail price house reasonable market condition call contractor assess condition property busy life work family activity realtor able necessary leg work find potential home work price believe market fit work repair necessary importantly add stress stressful situation potential buyer market find realtor work try normalize work,NEGATIVE,0.902384221553803,,,,

However, as information soon became overwhelming and the level of effort required to keep up with the market became crazy, I soon realized why we would need a good realtor.  Fortunately we met Maria, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience working with her as we were able to find our dream house in only 3 months's time.  <br/><br/>Briefly speaking, we couldn't have hoped for a better person for her role, as Maria was all that a realtor should be: knowledgeable, creative, passionate, accommodating, and thoughtful.

I was viewing properties in a matter of days which was no easy feat in the middle of the pandemic given in-person viewing restrictions but Maria found a way to make it happen.

(And I am honest to say I am a particular person, so that is saying a lot for me.) Amy actually sold my mother's home in May, and then helped us to purchase a new home in June.  Amy went far beyond what was expected of her as a real estate agent.  She read everything that was sent to us (even if it was not sent directly by her office) so that she could answer any questions we had -- and we often had questions!   We did a lot of remodeling at my mother's home  (which I coordinated), and the new home is uncommon as it has very large koi ponds and structures that are simply not generally found on properties.  For both properties, Amy also put a significant amount of personal effort into finding people and resources to help move things forward that would have been difficult for us to organize on our own.  She also has a keen attention to detail along with a supportive, calming energy that I deeply appreciate.  Buying and selling homes can be stressful; my mom and I spoke numerous times about how reassuring and calming Amy was for us. She often just touched base to see how we were doing for which I am grateful. I was also impressed with how quickly she responded to my questions. Finally, Amy is a very ethical person who clearly cares about the people with whom she works.  It was clear she felt a personal obligation to make sure we were satisfied, and I always felt I could trust Amy to have our best interests at heart.  My mother and I had not bought and/or sold homes in quite some time, and we realized as we moved forward (especially in today's market) that the ability to trust Amy with our well-being during the process was priceless.

We would send homes we liked to our realtor and they would just ignore it or say “okay, let me know when you want to see it” We went through this for a few months before reaching out to DM. Finally, when we reached out to DM we were looking at houses two days later! He tried to tell us the only way we will know forsure if we wanted a house, was to see many!

A home on 5 acres showed up and we sent it to DM. I was a bit hesitant at first, probably because I knew what my heart would say and it had already been on the market for 2 weeks which made me feel like I would fall in love and the property would slip out of my fingers. Well, he got us an appointment to see the home (the agent was very hard to get ahold of). I stepped out of the car and fell in love instantly.

Dhara fit all of those checkboxes perfectly for me! Furthermore, Dhara always went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable and taken care of throughout the (months-long) process. She started by walking me through the entire home buying process, scheduling several sessions to go over the all the paperwork and documentation. What looked like a daunting process filled with several forms, was broken down into chunks that were easy to understand! She told me things to look out for (and things to ignore) which made life easier when I was doing my research!She then scheduled tours for me and followed up after every tour to gauge my likes and dislikes. With each tour, she made a note of things that were important to me, based on which she was able to personalize and recommend better options. I am extremely picky and so I really appreciated her doing this!When I was finally ready to make an offer, she set the right expectations and told me what to expect in terms of offer details. However, what I most appreciated during this time was that she was constantly looking out for me. She never rushed me and instead told me to be patient (even if it meant taking longer to find me a perfect home) when I was ready to settle for something less than perfect.After finding a home I liked, she moved quickly to ensure I have a shot at having my offer accepted. When it did get accepted, she kept following up with all relevant stakeholders (listing agent, sellers, escrow company, mortgage company etc) to ensure things keep progressing at the right pace. She was organized and professional in dealing with any issues we came across. She even stepped in for me and followed up with people (and their managers) incase things started going off track, advising me on things I could/should do (despite it not being her responsibility to do so). It was extremely comforting to know that she had everything under control throughout the escrow process.Even once the process was finished, she continued looking out for me. She provided me with a list of utility and service provider recommendations (from movers and handymen to workout classes and movie theaters in the area). When she found out I had some issues with a utility and HOA - she stepped in and called them, resolving the issue for me! Even a month after moving in - she checked in to make sure I was settled in (and everything was working as intended). In all, working with Dhara was a dream come true. She is an extremely committed and caring professional - one who truly prioritizes her client's needs.

5,"4833 Hayter Ave, Lakewood, CA 90712",2012-08-26,"If you are looking for someone who knows the Lakewood, CA area (and is a short sale expert), Angie Ortiz is your realtor.<br/><br/>My husband and I were first time buyers and we knew that we wanted to settle near family, which meant Lakewood or Long Beach, CA. We began our search for a realtor in January of 2012 by spending weekends visiting open houses hoping we'd meet the right person. We came across Angie at an open house in Lakewood, CA. We met with her after her open house ended.<br/><br/>The next day Angie had offered to take us out to look at homes. She had spent a long time with us discussing what we were looking for in a realtor, what we were looking for as buyers, etc. With everything we had in mind, Angie showed us about 7 or 8 different homes to see how we felt about certain areas, home sizes, lots, prices, etc. She never made us sign a contract.<br/><br/>She was always very patient with us. We were going back and forth as to whether we should do an FHA program or 5% down conventional and Angie was patient as my husband and I did our research. We also wanted to see a LOT of homes, but this didn't seem to bother Angie.<br/><br/>Angie gave us access to a website called listingbooks where I was able to monitor daily the new homes that came up on the market and see the status of all the different homes in my price point. I knew what was available, pending, and sold. We would communicate on this website whenever I saw a home I wanted to see. She would always take us out the same day I saw something that caught my eye. Sometimes this meant we would meet her everyday to see a different home each day. There were times I found something last minute and there was never a time Angie wasn't there to meet us within half an hour to see the home.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the economy, the Lakewood market was saturated with short sales. My husband and I didn't realize this as we began a search for a realtor and it's lucky we ended up with Angie because we soon learned you needed a realtor very experienced in short sale transactions. It seemed that 90% of the homes my husband and I preferred and would end up writing offers for, were short sales. We were pretty selective in our home and we were willing to wait on short sale approvals.<br/><br/>We spent months waiting on short sales.Angie would keep us updated at a minimum every other day. But she was calling all parties involved on the back-end almost daily. She wasn't letting anything slip through the cracks. Whenever she received correspondence she would send the information our way. My husband and I were constantly updated and we knew exactly where everything stood throughout the process.<br/><br/>Angie wrote several offers for us. All our offers on homes that we really wanted were accepted. We had some rejections in our journey, but these were usually for homes we had just wanted to see where an offer might go. Angie was patient with us and did whatever we wanted to do.<br/><br/>Once we got approval on our short sale June 4, 2012, we closed in 36 days because Angie was on it! Anything she needed to do, final HUD approval, whatever it was, she was making sure it got done. I was definitely anxious to close the transaction and finally get into our new home and I'll never forget how responsive Angie was to get the transaction settled. <br/><br/>The day everything finally came together, Angie was waiting for us at our new home with champagne and our house wrapped in a bow. It was a difficult short sale transaction because of the banks involved, but without Angie, it wouldn't have gone as smooth as it had. She really knew what she was doing. Even after we closed escrow, Angie was there for any questions.<br/><br/>I don't know what the future will bring for me and my husband, but if we decide to sell our home one day and certainly if we have any friends or family looking to buy or sell, we will be calling Angie. We were always comfortable with her. She was patient. Never pushy and always available. She took our time seriously and I felt like she was really working for us. She also seemed to have a lot of professional resources as well. This was especially important to us being first time homebuyers. At the end of it all, we couldn't have asked for a better realtor. If you are looking to buy in Lakewood or Long Beach, CA and you want someone who really knows the neighborhood, who will get you the right home and who will really make the process as smooth as possible, you should definitely meet with Angie.

She was attentive, responsive and hardworking which allowed us to find the perfect place to call home in San Francisco's super competitive real estate market. When my wife and I initially sat down with Laura, we discussed what we were looking for in a house and she provided us with a very realistic ""state of the housing market,"" that allowed us to fine-tune our search. From that meeting on, Laura went into overdrive sending us properties to consider and she constantly made herself available for quick chats about houses my wife and I wanted to take tours of.  During tours, Laura was incredible at pointing out features about a property my wife and I would have completely overlooked and she offered tasteful suggestions about how we could move a small wall or arrange a room to really make a place our own. When the criteria for our search evolved after seeing different property types, Laura was able to schedule same-day tours that enabled my wife and I to fall in love with a specific neighborhood and then a specific house. When we initially walked through the property that's now our home on a Saturday afternoon, Laura, my wife and I all knew that we'd found something that we would be eager to submit an offer on.

5,"1841 Noemi Dr, Concord, CA 94519",2020-06-23,"Nancy has helped me buy two houses and list one house, which I ultimately took off the market. She helped me buy a house in Pittsburg and in Concord, so I am a repeat customer! She's a really nice person and extremely professional.Most importantly, she is there to PROTECT YOU and your rights, both as a selling agent and as a buying agent. Other agents who aren't as knowledgeable as Nancy will not be able to protect you the way you deserve.All of the star ratings describe Nancy perfectly:LOCAL KNOWLEDGE: She grew up in and around Concord, CA. She knows about commuting into Oakland and SF because she used to do that before becoming an RE Agent. She has raised children in the area and has many friends in the area, so she knows a lot about the schools and the neighborhoods. She knows lots of great places to eat, and she's always willing to drive you.PROCESS EXPERTISE: She has several years of experience. She's not a newby. She knows the whole process and stays on the ball with everyone involved in the process at all times - the financing company, the title company, the other agent, everybody. She's an agent the other players in the deal are not going to forget any time soon because she pushes them to make sure they are getting their jobs done promptly and correctly.RESPONSIVENESS: Nancy is up to speed with the latest technology. She returns texts, phone calls, and emails right away. And, again, she's always available when the financing company or title company needs to contact her. She'll be there for you!NEGOTIATION SKILLS: Nancy's skills worked especially well for me when buying my first house in Pittsburg. She was definitely the key factor that made the sellers choose me to sell the house to instead of someone else. Just trust me, she'll figure out a way to get you the house you want. If there is any wiggle room whatsoever, she'll figure out how to wiggle in there and get you that house. For my second house, not much negotiation was necessary, but she did get the sellers to pay for a few things that I might've had to pay for if I was working with an inexperienced RE Agent.CURRENT KNOWLEDGE: Nancy stays very up-to-date with current laws and market trends. She knows a lot about the laws, which is very important for an agent to know. This includes restrictions associated with certain loan types and building codes. She watches the market and can advise you about many different things, such as financial options, home updating recommendations, inspections. She has experience in rentals and ADUs, too, which is a PLUS. OBSERVANT AND KNOWLEDGEABLE: Nancy is super observant. Way more than any average person. She will walk into that house and tell you everything that's both good and bad. She will be honest with you about all the potential problems or benefits and not hide anything just to make the deal.NANCY IS THERE TO PROTECT YOU, no matter if you are buying or selling.

I live in San Francisco and wanted to move back to Southern California to be closer to my family. Once I began my search in earnest, she gave me valuable information about homes I wanted to tour in person, e.g., one property was contingent upon the owner finding a new property and wanting the buyer to lease back the home to them for six months. Mayra saved me time and frustration through her thorough research of my properties of interest. I started my home search with single family dwellings. After two trips to L.A. viewing homes, Mayra gently asked if I might also consider a condo as an option. I actually put two bids on condos. Mayra wrote up both offers within 24 hours. The sellers chose cash buyers. I finally decided to put an offer on a lovely mobile home that was so much larger than the other properties on which I bid. My niece, who lives locally, viewed the property on a Sunday afternoon. I contacted Mayra the next day to write up my offer. Within an hour, she had the offer ready for my signature. She negotiated a credit from the seller with ease. I closed escrow today. From viewing to close of escrow it has been 25 days!

Shortly after meeting and discussing houses, attending a few open houses together, Conor was able to walk into a house on his own and tell immediately if it suited me or not (I have very particular taste, but not limited to one architectural style or era). He was always right. It confirmed what a good sense he is able to get of his client and their wants/needs. He is also great with people. Everyone that we worked with at all stages was a fan, commenting on how much they liked him or would like to work with him, how good he was at staying on top of all the moving parts or coming up with creative ideas to keep us moving through the sluggish market.

In a nutshell, our other realtor quickly had us list our current house without hardly doing any marketing, had us accept an all cash/low-ball offer and all of the while, was a terrible communicator during the home selling + home hunting process. We always had to check in with our realtor, not other way around.Rafaela just so happened to be assigned by our agent to host the open house for our current house and the difference in level of customer service was a day and night difference, to the point that we ended up firing current realtor and switched over to having Rafaela represent us as our buyer's agent for our new home search.Upon our first interaction we were immediately impressed by Rafaela's calm presence and helpfulness in educating us about topics that we hadn't even discussed with our other realtor, such as bridge loans, which we realized had a huge importance in our house hunt, since like a lot of folks selling their house to buy a new one, were 100% dependent on the proceeds of selling our current house to use towards the down payment on our new house.Rafaela's level of customer service goes above and beyond. If we called her or texted her, she would always immediately respond and always made us feel that we were her top priority as clients. If we wanted to tour a house, she was always available to come join us and would give us her honest opinions on the pros and cons of all of the houses we were interested in.Considering that this is a seller's market, Rafaela was amazingly able to negotiate and get an offer accepted on our dream house within a week of hiring her as our buyer's agent! She did everything in her power to make our offer as competitive as possible, while also protecting our best interests and making sure that our offer was fair and not way above the asking price, which is what a lot of buyer's need to do to get their offers even considered. She is a sweetheart and even was willing to sacrifice some of her commission just to seal the deal on our new house.Even after our offer was accepted, Rafaela still stayed involved during the entire escrow process, referring us to contractors for anything that we needed fixed and was in constant contact with our home loan officers to make sure all of our paperwork was submitted on time, scheduled notaries on our behalf and did everything she could do to make the escrow process as hands off for us as possible.Whether you are looking to buy/sell a house in North County, South County or East County San Diego, we highly recommend using Rafaela.

After doing in-depth research on agents in the northeast San Diego area (Poway, RB, PQ), I met with Chad for a coffee to discuss our plans to purchase and all things real estate. It was great to know he grew up in RB, had extensive knowledge of the various neighborhoods in the area, and was well connected. He met my wife and kids when we viewed a house a couple weeks later, and after my wife gave the thumbs up based on his laid back and friendly approach, we decided to work together for our purchase.Buying a house in 2023 is far from an easy task, but Chad made it as smooth as possible. I also appreciated that he never tried to take an easy way or cut any corners. Even if it was fairly obvious we weren’t going to get a place based on the price we were willing to pay, he never shied away from meeting us and writing up an offer to give us a chance while also never pushing us to make an offer we weren’t 100% comfortable with. We also considered buying in Temecula, and he was more than happy to make the long drive to check out a couple places with us.We ultimately found an amazing home in RB that we absolutely love. Chad viewed the property before us and thought it might be a good fit even though we weren’t interested based on the photos. Chad was right, it was a perfect fit.

5,"13344 Verona Tustin, CA 92782",2022-06-29,"We met Bobby by chance while looking for single family homes in OC as we haven't yet an agent. On one of the properties we were eyeing, Bobby was very welcoming and took the initiative to show us the property. In this first interaction with him, we found him to be very kind and accommodating; and his general attitude of going above and beyond is what sold us to select him as our agent ... It was a big risk given that we did not know Bobby, nor have we been referred to him.  We literally had met him only on that first instance.We definitely struck gold with Bobby as he has really proven to be an excellent agent ... not just in the general routines and processes of viewing properties, making offers and finalizing the sale, but his customer service skills surrounding each step of the process is noteworthy.  He is very responsive to our concerns, has always been timely in returning our calls and emails, and helps mediate between all parties (seller, lender, and buyer).  We appreciated how he kept us on track and would send gentle reminders in completing documents etc.His interpersonal skills are wonderful. He is very encouraging, very positive, and respectful to the clients.   Yet, on top of all his already wonderful attributes, we also realized that Bobby  and his team are just awesome at negotiations.  Given our budget for an OC property, and the competitive nature of securing a sale in 2022, I am really just amazed how Bobby and his team were able to have our offer selected despite other offers that were a bit higher.  I'm thinking that the sellers were also impressed with Bobby and his team's attitude and they have seen the value of the type of hardwork, efficiency, and dedication that Bobby can commit to the negotiating table that other agents just cannot match.  This is why we feel that the haphazard encounter with Bobby at the very beginning was like finding the golden key.  We are very appreciative that he has delivered and got us a home, despite the market challenges and our financial abilities. We are really impressed by him and his team for pulling through.  We are confident that other clients will be pleased with him.

We very actively looked for homes for under 2 months, bid on  one home and in the end competed against 2 other offers for the home we ended up successfully purchasing. <br/><br/>Why we liked working with Anshu:<br/><br/>* anshu was always available to us and would always promptly respond to email / calls.  <br/><br/>* Anshu over communicates in order to be very clear that she understands what we want and that we understand what she advises.  <br/><br/>* She did not push us into homes nor did she push us away from homes.  Instead she asked us how we felt about the home after each visit and let us come to our own decisions.  If we were unsure, we asked her for her personal/professional opinion and only then would she influence our decision.  <br/><br/>* Negotiations with the seller's agent were tough and hiccups from delayed financing made the purchase process stressful at times.  It is easy to get emotional and react to various situations during the process, especially when it involves purchasing something so expensive.

I was referred to Shelly by my loan agent (whom is also great!). When we started in winter last year the market was a bit slow but inventory in Cupertino area was low and there were still bidding wars. It was challenging to find a house that meets all on our wish list but still stay in our budget. Shelly is very resourceful, patient, professional and responsive. I almost passed the listing of our current home if she didn't call us about this opportunity. With her resources and negotiation skills, we got the house at a price under listed price/market price without going through a bidding war (and it was the first offer we made). Now we've moved into our new home for 2 months and we are definitely enjoying the house and the area.After our offer was accepted by the seller, we started selling our previous house immediately as we worried the housing price would drop in Sunnyvale (and looks like it did). It was an extremely stressful time trying to sell the house while still living in it (and with a 6 month old baby). Luckily, Shelly helped to make the process as smooth as possible. And there were times she went above and beyond to help us prepare for ad hoc showings.

Within two weeks we found the townhouse that was perfect for us. It was a highly sought after property with multiple offers, and Jeff used a combination of tenacity and business savvy to get our offer accepted. The selling agent even told me personally that if it wasn't for Jeff's clever structuring of the offer, they might have gone with another bid! Jeff then navigated us effortlessly through the inspection process, making the necessary appointments for us and always being present with us to help us go through the process.

5,"815 Pelton Ave Santa Cruz, CA 95060",2023-09-27,"We worked with Rose Wood on the recent purchase of our home in the lower westside neighborhood of Santa Cruz. For those of you in the Santa Cruz housing market, you know that supply is limited and much patience is required. She stuck with us for 1.5 years of house hunting, multiple offers, and much learning as new home buyers. Throughout it all, Rose treated us with the utmost care, patience, and support. She was trustworthy, transparent, thoughtful, highly skilled, deeply knowledgable, and the perfect fit for us. We always felt that Rose had our best interests at heart and was an amazing advocate and teammate throughout. As first time home buyers, Rose would answer every question we had, no matter how big or small. She is incredibly good with people and also incredibly smart and gifted at her job. If we ever texted Rose with a question, she'd promptly respond with a phone call to make sure the question was answered and that we understood all the angles. If we wanted to see a house, she'd show up in-person to walk through it with us and in the rare event she was unavailable, she'd make sure we were very well cared for. Every listing agent we met would ask, ""who's your realtor?"" and when we'd say we work with Rose, they'd all look impressed and say, ""oh, Rose is the best!"" I'm embarrassed to admit, but we actually felt an undeserved pride just in our association with Rose, like we had won the realtor lottery. We know Rose has other clients, many of which were probably ""bigger fish"" than us, and yet, Rose always made us feel like we were the most important ones to her. When we finally found the right home, Rose deftly navigated the behind the scenes conversations inherent to hot homes with multiple offers and got us across the finish line in first place. After we closed, the listing agent even wrote us to say, and we quote, ""Hats off to your realtor. Rose is top-notch, you picked a good one."" We could go on and on about Rose, but suffice to say that we loved working with her, and would rate her 11 out of 10 if that was possible.

5,"77 Carmelita St San Francisco, CA 94117",2022-05-08,"Where do I even start. Anna truly goes above and beyond for her clients and is SO much more to me than just a real estate agent. She’s more like my real-estate guardian angel / guru that made “buying my dream house in SF” come true!I first met Anna 3 years ago when I was tentatively looking at buying in SF. I had met several agents at that time, but she left a deep impression on me as someone who was highly intelligent, savvy and capable, emotionally perceptive, and understood me very quickly as a person and a client. I instantly liked her and felt that I could trust her. At that time, I decided I wasn’t yet ready to buy. In Fall 2021, I started to think about buying again and got back in touch with Anna. She remembered everything about me, like an old friend, and we picked right back up. At that time, I hadn’t done any homework - I didn’t have a clear price-range or neighborhood in mind, and I hadn’t even started a mortgage application. No matter - Anna will help get you on your feet. ?My story is a bit of a fairy tale because the first listing that I got from Anna was literally my dream house - she knew exactly what I was looking for - a charming Victorian in a sweet neighborhood that was perfectly renovated and turn-key ready. It was the first house we went to go see, and long story short, I GOT IT. I can still hardly believe it. SF has a notoriously competitive housing market with crazy bidding wars, and I had friends who looked for 3-5 years until they finally landed their first home. But Anna help me sail through all of this. The house was showing for one weekend only, and accepting offers on a Wednesday. I didn’t even have a bank loan that Monday morning, but Anna and my banking team worked together seamlessly and I was ready by Tuesday evening to put in an offer. SO much happened in those 2 days. I honestly had no idea what I was doing but thankfully had the guidance of Anna every step of the way, to feel comfortable reading through and understanding all the documents about the house, inspections, and ultimately pitching my opening offer that was based on Anna’s market analysis. She reviewed every detail with me and held my hand through it all. It was such a relief to have someone I could trust to counsel me correctly. There were 9 offers and I was in the top 3. My offer was just high enough to get me in the conversation - Anna had advised me well. There was a round of counter-offers, and much to my surprise, the seller came back to me with a direct counter-offer. In retrospect I believe this happened because of the advice Anna gave me in how the offer was contracted, and because Anna had a solid reputation that allowed the other party to feel confident that we could close escrow successfully and expeditiously. At that moment, I wasn’t fully mentally prepared to buy a home as I had just started my search and this was literally the first house I looked at - and now the opportunity was sitting in my lap. I had an hour to decide, and Anna at this point was acting as my therapist (bless her!) listening to me struggle with: “I don’t know how to know if I’m ready.” She ultimately talked me through the moment and it was just what I needed to hear to make the right choice. I signed and the house was mine! In the following weeks, we had to close escrow and the real work began. I work as a surgeon and have a very demanding schedule. Anna was able to work with me incredibly efficiently and effective, juggling so many moving parts during a crunched time line to make it all happen.  I was a first time home-owner, and getting settled in after the move was like learning a new language. After buying the house, I didn’t expect Anna to still be involved but she has continued to be my biggest ally and support through that process too. She routinely sends out a “best practices” review to her clients of everything she had identified during the buying process that I might want to clean up and look into with the house, recommended services / inspections, plumbers / electricians, and continued to check in on me when I needed it.I have leaned on Anna for so much over the past 6 months to the point that I feel bad bothering her sometimes, but she is always at the ready to help me with a positive can-do attitude.  In summary, Anna has been a godsend. She’s amazingly quick, reliable, whip-smart, competent, people smart, situationally smart, and well recognized and trusted in the real estate community.  In addition to her incredible attributes as a professional, I also absolutely adore Anna as a person - she is a total badass, funny and smart with a big heart, down to earth, understanding, and easy to work with. I feel so blessed that I crossed paths with her years ago, found her again, and had her in my corner to make my dream come true in buying my first house in San Francisco - a place I absolutely love and am so happy to call home.",start anna truly go client real estate agent like real estate guardian angel guru buy dream house sf come meet anna 3 year ago tentatively look buy sf meet agent time leave deep impression highly intelligent savvy capable emotionally perceptive understand quickly person client instantly like feel trust time decide ready buy fall 2021 start think buy get touch anna remember like old friend pick right time homework clear price range neighborhood mind start mortgage application matter anna help foot story bit fairy tale list get anna literally dream house know exactly look charming victorian sweet neighborhood perfectly renovated turn key ready house go long story short get hardly believe sf notoriously competitive housing market crazy bidding war friend look 3 5 year finally land home anna help sail house show weekend accept offer wednesday bank loan monday morning anna banking team work seamlessly ready tuesday evening offer happen 2 day honestly idea thankfully guidance anna step way feel comfortable reading understand document house inspection ultimately pitch opening offer base anna market analysis review detail hold hand relief trust counsel correctly 9 offer 3 offer high conversation anna advise round counter offer surprise seller come direct counter offer retrospect believe happen advice anna give offer contract anna solid reputation allow party feel confident close escrow successfully expeditiously moment fully mentally prepared buy home start search literally house look opportunity sit lap hour decide anna point act therapist bless listen struggle know know ready ultimately talk moment need hear right choice sign house follow week close escrow real work begin work surgeon demanding schedule anna able work incredibly efficiently effective juggle move part crunch time line happen time home owner getting settle like learn new language buy house expect anna involve continue big ally support process routinely send good practice review client identify buying process want clean look house recommend service inspection plumber electrician continue check need lean anna past 6 month point feel bad bother ready help positive attitude summary anna godsend amazingly quick reliable whip smart competent people smart situationally smart recognize trust real estate community addition incredible attribute professional absolutely adore anna person total badass funny smart big heart earth understanding easy work feel blessed cross path year ago find corner dream come true buy house san francisco place absolutely love happy home,POSITIVE,0.982058227062225,,,,

5,"400 Spear St #113 San Francisco, CA 94105",2022-04-21,"I would like to write a recommendation for our realtor, Jennifer Long. There are at least 10 reasons why our purchasing experience with her was exceptional. I’d like to point out that my experience working with Jennifer was my 3rd lifetime experience in purchasing real estate. Jennifer, as the 3rd, was truly the charm & proved that not all realtors are created equally. Jennifer was punctual. This is common sense, but not everyone has the discipline to do it. She was flawless. Jennifer showed expertise with total ease. Not just with the technical pieces. She was always willing to go the extra mile with any research specific to the different locations we were looking at. Just when you think you might know an area, Jennifer will have something up her sleeve to share. She invested the time to research best restaurants or farmer’s markets, places of interest that she knew would personally interest us as the buyers. Jennifer was accommodating. If we needed to make a change or had a request for something, she figured it out. I was flying in from out of state which might have made scheduling appointments a little trickier, but wasn't an issue with Jennifer ! Jennifer, a complete stranger to us up until this transaction, made us feel like we were almost friends. She was consistently friendly and positive. The best part is, when she needed to be aggressive on our behalf, she wasn’t afraid to do so. She became the mama bear protecting her cubs which is exactly what you want in a realtor. Jennifer was patient. Even after we made an offer on one property, changed our mind and backed out of it, she never even hinted at being annoyed or frustrated. She was the calm leader in our journey. Jennifer was a hard worker. I think she understands the “old-fashioned” meaning of earning a commission & earning the trust of the people she serves. She cares about making connections. I think she treats the purchasing process as if she herself is the buyer & this truly makes a difference. At the conclusion of our purchasing journey, we were further surprised by very personal “Welcome Home” gifts from Jennifer, & this included a treat for our dog! I recommend Jennifer without any hesitation.",like write recommendation realtor jennifer long 10 reason purchasing experience exceptional like point experience work jennifer 3rd lifetime experience purchase real estate jennifer 3rd truly charm prove realtor create equally jennifer punctual common sense discipline flawless jennifer show expertise total ease technical piece willing extra mile research specific different location look think know area jennifer sleeve share invest time research good restaurant farmer market place interest know personally interest buyer jennifer accommodate need change request figure fly state scheduling appointment little tricky issue jennifer jennifer complete stranger transaction feel like friend consistently friendly positive good need aggressive behalf afraid mama bear protect cub exactly want realtor jennifer patient offer property change mind back hint annoy frustrate calm leader journey jennifer hard worker think understand old fashioned meaning earn commission earn trust people serve care make connection think treat purchasing process buyer truly make difference conclusion purchasing journey surprise personal welcome home gift jennifer include treat dog recommend jennifer hesitation,POSITIVE,0.982274651527405,,,,

He was professional in his approach, in addition to being very friendly and personable.  He had a very professional flyer with wonderful photographs of the house we eventually purchased.  He had a good understanding of the current housing market, which helped us to feel comfortable in making an offer on a home.  He showed us several houses.  When we found one we wanted, he helped craft a proposal fair for the seller as well as the buyer, which eliminated the game of some (or many) counter proposals.  He was able to obtain information from the sellers regarding utilities used, yard maintenance, pest control and the person who looked after the house when the owners were not in residence.  He set up the desired house inspections.  Several times with the owners he set up ""walk throughs"" for us.  Since we purchased the house furnished, he requested that the sellers ""tag"" the items that would not remain, to avoid any misunderstanding and possible problems.   Steve is very thorough.  He made sure all paperwork was filled out correctly, completely and signed (and there was a considerable amount).  He went through all the many forms with us and made sure we understood them.

5,"201-205 Coleridge St San Francisco, CA 94110",2023-05-18,"If you are looking to buy or sell a property in San Francisco, please do not look further beyond Yesenia Rogers at the Ruth Krishnan team. I have worked with realtors across multiple geographies and can spot a good one from a mile away. Yesenia grew up in San Francisco and knows the city like the back of her hand. Whilst most realtors can tell you if a neighborhood is good or bad, Yesenia will tell you about the pros/cons of that specific block/street within a neighbourhood. The highlight of working with Yesenia is that she never pushes you in any direction and truly cares about getting you a property that meets your needs. She has an amazing ability to highlight the pros and cons of a property so that you are empowered to make the decision. I was amazed that Yesenia would make it a point to highlight the downsides of a property to ensure that I was making a truly informed decision rather than an emotional one. I pivoted my property search in a few different directions during the process and Yesenia always asked the right questions that helped to progress the decision making process. Yesenia was very amenable to accomodate my working style. She runs a buyer analysis to understand your preferences and will work hard to optimize the process so that you do not end up visiting a bunch of properties that don't meet your needs. Yesenia has a great sense of how a property is priced (under/over/at-par) so that's very helpful in making decisions. She has a good reputation amongst the SF realtor community which means that she can help you write a better offer, get clarifications, negotiate the price and terms. I had last minute jitters as I was about to finalize an offer and Yesenia was able to help structure my thoughts so that I could make a logical decision. The entire Ruth Krishnan organization works to make everything like a well oiled engine which implies that the customer does not have a single point of failure which may be the case if you work with a realtor that does not have a team backing them. They make the process as easy as possible for you by ensuring that you can electronically sign documents, preparing a summary of disclosures, comps, being available to answer all questions, referring experts (lawyers, contractors), etc. I never felt pushed to write an offer and Yesenia always put my interests above trying to close a transaction. It is evident that she is trying to build a long term relationship and not close a single transaction. Most importantly, it was a fun and enjoyable experience working with Yesenia on a significant life decision.",look buy sell property san francisco look yesenia roger ruth krishnan team work realtor multiple geography spot good mile away yesenia grow san francisco know city like hand whilst realtor tell neighborhood good bad yesenia tell pro con specific block street neighbourhood highlight work yesenia push direction truly care get property meet need amazing ability highlight pro con property empower decision amazed yesenia point highlight downside property ensure make truly inform decision emotional pivot property search different direction process yesenia ask right question help progress decision making process yesenia amenable accomodate working style run buyer analysis understand preference work hard optimize process end visit bunch property meet need yesenia great sense property price par helpful make decision good reputation sf realtor community mean help write well offer clarification negotiate price term minute jitter finalize offer yesenia able help structure thought logical decision entire ruth krishnan organization work like oil engine imply customer single point failure case work realtor team back process easy possible ensure electronically sign document prepare summary disclosure comp available answer question refer expert lawyer contractor etc felt push write offer yesenia interest try close transaction evident try build long term relationship close single transaction importantly fun enjoyable experience work yesenia significant life decision,POSITIVE,0.989165246486664,,,,

Having known Angel for the better part of 10 years, I saw him work tirelessly on behalf of his clients to build not just a business, but a life changing mission to serve others through making dreams come true. Angel is the ultimate professional yet is so relatable in so many ways to his clients unique needs and stories. I am convinced that he doubles as a therapist at night. The guy is confident and successful, the exact kind of person that you need in your corner when buying or selling a house in this market. In the most competitive market in history, Angel did what no other real estate professional could do for me, find us a house that didn’t exist in the market, and at a price that would make a grown man cry (in a good way). He started with the brutal honest truth about my low budget, the competitiveness of the market, and the shortage of inventory. I mean I must have called him and emailed him a hundred times and he was graceful and understanding with all of it. He truly knows and cares for PEOPLE and the business comes second. I was a VA loan customer and a first time home buyer. With the cards stacked against me in the market, Angel and I scoured the market meticulously and found the needle in the haystack. It was like Chevy Chase finding the perfect Christmas tree in the forest, we found the one and bought it. No really, he found the house and we literally signed the same night. During the process, I thought that Angel was going to have to do a miracle to get us in a house, the night we signed the contract was that miracle. He handled literally all of the inspections, appraisals, walkthroughs, and 1,000 questions. He knew when to calm my anxiety and when to bring me back to reality. As a public school teacher and former service member, he always seemed so thankful that he got to help me, while I remain immensely thankful to him.I will forever be grateful to Angel Lopez for changing my family’s life. We rented for 8 years before this and only dreamed of owning our own home and raising a family in it.  Someday this house will generate generational wealth to my future kids and beyond.

Spencer was # 3 on the list to contact. We called him and briefly let him know what we were looking to do. Spencer sent us more information about him and a great detail information about the home buying process. No pressure, he just called to follow up asking if we needed anything else, we weren’t a client yet. He said, let him know if we needed more information or had any questions. We did contact the first 2 on our list, however, Spencer’s availability, responsiveness and willingness to help, even though we not a client yet, was first rate. So we decided to go with Spencer.

5,"26182 Via Monterey San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675",2021-11-04,"There are numerous (5-star) ?? ???????? real estate professionals in Southern California, particularly in South Orange County, and Robyn Seymour Real Estate is one of them.There are 37 towns comprised of Orange County, each being distinct, and finding a real estate professional must be unique to the community in which the home is bought or sold. Every California real estate person claims to cover the entire state if needed, but that would lead to different outcomes. Robyn has decades of experience focusing on homes from (North) Laguna Beach to (South) San Clemente and from (East) Mission Viejo to (West) Aliso Viejo. There is a constant demand for this region, and it requires not only someone who is knowledgeable about the area but someone who also lives in the area and gets involved in community events. To have a feel for the community, you must visit, but to truly experience it, you must live there.Her in-depth knowledge of recent property values, taxation, and investment opportunities based on up-to-date zoning laws and local government regulations has allowed her to excel in measuring these variables. In addition to holding parties at various events throughout her community of South Orange County, such as the Pageant of the Masters (Laguna Beach), Music in the Park (San Juan Capistrano), and Festivals of Lights (Dana Point. Throughout the year, she assists clients with organizing various holiday events such as holiday season caroling parties, St. Patrick's Day festivities with Irish dancing, and outdoor events in the parks and beaches.She recently facilitated discussions about taxes, family trusts, and identifying California's ADUs for clients who have relatives with special needs, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. She provides other services, including matching renters with rental properties.As a client of hers, I recommend if you ever want to buy a home in South Orange County, you need someone who can give you the information, facts, and real-world experience that come with living in Orange County; not someone who is just interested in closing a deal. Today's technology enables most of the basics of real estate to be completed online with the real estate agent performing an open house as the only function. When it comes to me selecting a real estate professional, I think I would want one who is connected to the community, who lives in the experience I must deal with for the long term.

Through many more emails and phone conversations, Norm put together our offer and we were on our way to closing.

Here are some highlights:- From the beginning to the end of the process, Michele was proactively on top of every detail. She identified houses for sale as soon as (or before) they hit the market and made sure we had viewing appointments right away. This was critical because, at the time, homes were selling within a week or less. - Had good relationships with selling agents to help understanding timing of process for bids, buyers’ expectations, etc. Again, all valuable, if not essential, information in this market. - Was available when we needed her, particularly during the final negotiation, which happened late in the evening. We had a narrow window to close the deal and Michele’s role was critical. - Managed the entire escrow and closing paperwork process, making sure we hit all the dates and deadlines. - Booked inspectors during escrow and made recommendations for contractors and tradespeople for after closing.

5,"1976 Somerdale Cir, Roseville, CA 95661",2017-09-27,"Sharon Crowley from Lyon was our realtor for our recent purchase of our dream home in Roseville, CA. I am writing this review to express how she was truly an amazing agent in multiple ways. We immediately fell in love with a house which she was showing and she did everything in her power to turn a dream into reality. Our situation was certainly not easy as we had to sell our existing home in Land Park in order to purchase the new home. Sharon showed a human and compassionate side in the cut throat world of real estate. She guided us through the process and gave us stellar advice which we followed and the result was a seamless transaction.  Sharon was professional, fair and patient with us. She has extensive knowledge of the market, the Roseville area, and the ins and outs of our home. She was ALWAYS available and very diligent in returning our calls and answering our questions. She was patient with us and answered the many questions we had throughout the process. She always kept us informed and there was never a shaky moment. There were a few items which the seller did not fix in our home and Sharon was kind enough to take it upon herself to fix several items throughout the home. We couldn’t be happier with our experience with Sharon. If you are looking for a knowledgeable agent, straight shooter who has a warm compassionate side, look no further, Sharon Crowley of Lyon is the agent you are looking for.UPDATE******Hello, I just wanted to add a note and demonstrate just how fantastic of a person and agent Sharon has been. I have been meaning to write this update earlier however, I have been extremely busy. We purchased our home end of August and it was not until late November that i realized that we had some pretty major HVAC issues because our upstairs unit would not heat up. I tried fiddling with it with no luck and then decided to call Sharon to see if she would guide us. I left her a message and she IMMEDIATELY called back and was genuinely very concerned with our situation. She sent someone out right away and had the heater fixed (failed motherboard control unit) and it started working better than new right away. It is relieving to have people like Sharon in this world, to take care of their clients even long after their loan has closed and transaction has processed.

5,"1857 William Bird Ave, Sacramento, CA 95835",2019-09-09,"When I first contacted Ed, I was more or less walking into the market with a blindfold and earmuffs on - I was relatively new to the area, and I was a first time buyer. I had an idea of the area I wanted to buy into and that's about it, everything else about homes was explained and walked through during our house visits. He had taught me so many things, ranging from the surrounding neighborhoods to the signing process to the general designs of the housing eras, and more. I can say without a doubt in my mind that he is a fountain of real estate knowledge, you just have to make sure to ready to soak it all up.What made me realize Ed was the realtor for me was that he had my interest at heart. I won't lie, in hindsight I did not communicate to him as well as I should have on what I was looking for and wanted. However, he was the one to ask questions, picked up on my habits, and looked for common features in the homes we visited to figure out what I wanted. That's great, except... I did a complete 180 and entered into contract on a home that was almost nothing like what we had looked at before because I had a random gut feeling about it. Whenever we met during the two weeks I could back out of the contract, Ed kept asking if I had found what I was looking for and if I was absolutely certain. During those two weeks, it felt more like Ed was more a friend trying to look out for me, than my realtor. There are so many positive things I can write about, but I wanted to keep it kind of short so I only talked about two things that truly stuck out to me. So what's the catch? What's about Ed's negatives? Well, he can be kind of goofy at times and LOVES to talk about things with you. So if you want a strictly business realtor, he's not for you.In my opinion, Ed is a fantastic realtor and I would highly recommend him to anyone. Having him as my realtor was such a pleasant experience that I wished the journey wasn't over.

5,"819 N Ferger Ave, Fresno, CA 93728",2020-08-02,"My husband and I embarked on a cross-country move to Fresno -- where neither of us had ever been -- and set out to buy our first home during a global pandemic, a pregnancy, and a job change. From the first conversation we had with Lindsay, she radiated positivity about Fresno and confident optimism about doing this whole process across geographical and social distancing. Usually when we told people we were moving to Fresno, we were met with quizzical looks or grim warnings. But Lindsay was a literal spring of enthusiasm about all things Fresno. She was, however, frank with us about what we should know about Fresno in order to find a niche where we would feel at home and would find a sense of belonging (because as we've learned, there are whole worlds within Fresno).As we embarked on the process of looking for houses in a rapidly heating up seller's market, Lindsay joined us as an enthusiastic collaborator in our house-hunting spreadsheets. She took us on FaceTime tours with detailed narrations of the houses and the neighborhoods. Her knowledge as an appraiser was invaluable, both as a guide for two people buying a house sight-unseen, and also as an education as we considered houses that came with a long list of home-improvement projects.Once we'd made the leap and entered into escrow, Lindsay became our full-time educator, cheerleader, and counselor. There was a LOT that we didn't know about buying a house, negotiating the deal, getting it financed, and maintaining our sanity. Lindsay has been doing this for 17 years but never once did she make us feel like our questions were stupid or that we should have known things that we didn't know. She navigated us through the process, and then when all the balls were in other people's courts she was a source of moral support because there was nothing to do but manage our own anxiety and keep a sense of humor.As closing day approached and we breathed a collective sigh of relief, Lindsay shared her incredible network of people with us. We needed everything from a carpenter to a termite fumigator to a good place to eat. Lindsay set us up with her people, called in favors for us, and genuinely rejoiced with us as she gave us house keys and succulents for our front porch. We could not be more grateful for how much time, education, and care Lindsay gave us during this process.

Throughout the entire, somewhat daunting process, John and Maitri were knowledgeable, available, and supportive.  Working with them was easy and efficient, and throughout the process their rich knowledge of real estate (Maitri also has experience working on the mortgage brokering side) and San Francisco (John’s experience in the city is long and his knowledge of the ins and outs of SF is vast) made us feel comfortable and confident.  As this was our first home purchase, we were hesitant to rush in to anything and took our time exploring neighborhoods and open houses to determine where we wanted to live and what we were looking for in a house.  John and Maitri did not rush us and emphasized the importance of us feeling comfortable with any decision we made.  They were patient with us as we made endless spreadsheets and over time changed our minds as to what we were looking for, what neighborhoods we were targeting, and what our budget looked like.  Their support during this period allowed us to narrow in on what actually mattered to us and also to get a much better feel for the rhythm of the SF housing market especially with regards to pricing.  All of this culminated in us being completely ready by the time we made our first offer - we had pre-approvals in place from multiple lenders, understood all the terms of the disclosures and the offer letters, and had a very good sense not only for what we wanted in a house but also for how much we thought would be fair to pay in such a crazy market.

We ended up selling our home and searching for a new one during a pandemic, which created it's own set of problems. We originally had a different realtor and made the choice to switch over to Stephen because the market was extremely competitive and we felt our original realtor was unable to help us obtain a home. We were left in limbo with our home sold and no new one in sight when we made the swap. I'm confident if we had been partnered with Stephen from the beginning - our house hunt would've looked VERY different. From the moment we started working with him, he was really great about listening to our wants and needs for a new home. We truly appreciated the fact that he listened and retained that information throughout our search and didn't waste our time (or his) showing us properties that weren't within those perimeters. What truly made our experience different with Stephen was his ability to understand the market conditions, the family he was helping, and his perfect balance of kindness and aggressiveness. We ended up in a bidding war and got the home of our dreams, thanks to Stephen, without having to throw away money or offer up our first-born. HA. He truly helped make us the most attractive buyers in a market where homes were lasting only a day or people were overpaying $30k+. We really valued his clear and prompt communication, his honesty, his quickness at showing us new listings both online and in person, and how wonderful he was at being the liaison between all the people involved in purchasing a new home.

5,"1631 Pastel Glen, Escondido, CA, 92029",2014-04-22,"As first time home buyers we were incredibly nervous at the thought of making the wrong decision when the time came to make the big purchase.  We didn’t know where to look or what to look for.  We did some background research and decided to find a realtor.  Unfortunately, we started off with the wrong one.  He simply showed us properties we requested to see.  Looking back at those listings today, it’s unbelievable they were on our consideration list.  It came to a point when we thought we would never find the right house, and we gave up looking for awhile.   Then we realized that prices will only be going up in the near future and decided to start our search again, but this time with someone new.  I can sincerely say that we were incredibly lucky when a close friend introduced us to Nino.  After our first meeting, we had no doubts that we found the right person.  She is incredibly passionate about helping others find the right home and make that process as seamless as possible.  We never had a single doubt about her along the way.  She educated us and guided us to make sure we had the confidence and information to make the right decision when the time came.   It took six months, but we finally found the right home.  Unfortunately, at that point in time we were planning our wedding and honeymoon.  One can only imagine the stress of having to deal with three major events occurring simultaneously in a matter of less than two months. Needless to say the final documents were to be signed while we were away on our honeymoon outside the states.  We can’t state it enough of how grateful we were to have her as our realtor during this time.  She treated our home purchase as if it was her own.  She was meticulously involved with the lender and the buyer at all times, constantly looking out for our best interest. She kept her cool and confidence even at moments of stress (even when the seller wanted to back out).    Sometimes you have so many wonderful things to say about someone, that you are lost for words.  In all sincerity we have so many wonderful things to say about Nino that it would take more than a few paragraphs to express our gratitude.  We could not imagine having anyone else help us make the one of the biggest decisions of our lives.  We recommended her to our families, and when my father in law is ready to sell and my brother is ready to buy, we can only hope she will still be in the business.

One time, after lost several bids, we decided to bid on a house close to Miramonte Ave. in Los Altos. It was a nice house with a good plan. So we told her that we want to write a contract for it. But Diana asked us if we have noticed there was a stop sign in the nearby corner, and suggested that we should come back during the traffic hours to check out the noise. We followed her instruction and came back during the traffic hour. Sure enough, there were more cars than we expected, and cars stopped and went, and did make noise much more than we expected. Of course, we didn’t go for that house. During the whole process, we really trust her and her opinions because we knew she would find the best for us.

We were very fortunate to meet her in our first “stop-by” open house visit back in 2018 where she happened to be the helper for the listing agent, since then our journey and friendship begins. So far, we have purchased two houses and successfully refinanced lower rate mortgage for several times with the help of her. We highly recommend Alice if you are looking to either buy/sell or even refinance a home, and we’ll definitely work with her again when we’re ready to make another move. Back in 2018, we were just new to the market, and buying a house can be a very scary and tough process, yet with Alice everything seemed easy and smooth. Professionalism, knowledge, empathy, are some of the words that we would use to describe her. 1.She took the time to listen to what we were looking for in a place, and was honest and upfront with how we should align our expectations. We always felt supported, from our biggest concerns to the smallest details we found in her a strong guidance. There was not a single time that I felt that I was being pushed into something I didn’t like. 2.Not to mention that she always created several analyzed reports to share with us before our weekend opening house tour so that we could have big pictures about the market for each difference area. Ex. list of recent sold properties, list of similar house comparison, details of the house, etc.    3.Communication was always on point and she went above and beyond to ensure the process was smooth and transparent.She was always available to discuss any doubts or concerns we had. She was able to translated the mountains of paperwork into understandable language to us and also provide us suggestions as necessary. 4.During the offer submission, she was able to analyze our offer and always made sure the offer was right for us. She had her strategy to follow up with the selling agent and making sure we know and do exactly what is needed to win the offer.5.During the closing process, she would also recalculate and double check if the calculation are correct from the title and loan company. Really appreciate to her that she helped us catch up so many errors that we even did not notice during the process, and she notified both title and loan company in a timely manner.6.Also, the excellent thing is that she also helped us constantly checking the ratio, and would inform us whenever the mortgage rate is lower than the original. We have been constantly doing refinance since 2018.

We were looking for a home to support our growing family in a competitive market and Joey made the process easy and exciting for us. Joey is the guy you’d want on your side, he knows this business, and he fights for his clients the way you’d fight for family. During our buying experience, we were interested in a particular house, and after Joey got an inkling that something wasn’t exactly as advertised, he pulled the thread on the problem and steered us in the right direction rather than letting us continue chasing after a house that wouldn’t have been perfect for us. We felt we were in good hands and glad to have him on our team! If you’re looking for an expert - Joey is your guy. He knows this process like the back of his hand, and specifically the San Diego market. Any questions we had, any time of day, he was always willing to hop on a phone call and detail everything for us. If you’re a first time buyer, Joey will never make you feel dumb for asking any and all questions, and if you’re experienced in real estate, you can trust him for back up. He’s built a wealth of knowledge and a whole network of connections that make him a great choice if you’re in the market for a realtor. Any tricks and tips he has, he will share with you. His transparency made it clear that he was a professional committed to the success of his clients - just trying to get people what they are looking for!Finally, Joey fights for his clients like no other. When negotiating on items in the escrow process, we gave Joey our ideal list of what we wanted to be corrected after the inspection and he came back with the whole list as a go. After that, when the appraisal came in lower than expected, he negotiated down to exactly what we wanted, which we thought would be a miracle. Joey respects his clients and their boundaries/desires and works tirelessly to make it happen - we routinely joked during these negotiations that we were “unleashing Joey” at whatever obstacle we faced.

5,"17320 Columbia Dr, Castro Valley, CA 94552",2014-10-22,"Charles Norman is the best realtor I've ever worked with.<br/><br/>Charles was responsive to our needs.  He understood what my wife and I were looking for, and focused his energy and ours, on properties that met our guidlines.  Sounds obvious enough, but I can't emphasize how important it is to use the limited energy and time we professionals have on looking only at homes of the right size, bedroom and bath count, location and school preferences.  Next, Charles has a wealth of knowledge and understanding about the quality of structures.  He helped us steer clear of certain homes that while appearing in good shape, were masking previous problems and future headaches.  He would walk through the property and show us the evidence of issues in the structure or yard and told us to stay away from properties we might have otherwise mistakenly committed ourselves to.  Finally, Charles has an understanding of the flow and functionality of homes.  While we got caught up in certain elements we liked, he would present the advantages and shortcomings of different floor plans and architectural elements to give us the ability to make an informed decision.<br/><br/>Unlike previous experiences, Charles was not interested in selling us a home we might regret.  More and more, my wife and I begun to rely on his insight to make sure that we weren't making a mistake.  The result, was that when we did finally find a home we liked, it was a home that flowed, that was built well, that was priced correctly, and that we are so happy to call our home.<br/><br/>What is also important to add, is that Charles worked with us on strategies to win the bid for the home without overspending.  In my exuberance, I was ready to offer what ultimately ended up being $40K more than what we spent, thanks to Charles.  If you're still reading you've probably already realized the point I'm making is that Charles is a realtor you can trust to look out for you.  If you've worked with many realtors, you'll know what an absolutely rare and wonderful characteristic that is.<br/><br/>After purchasing our home, we didn't think twice about asking Charles to sell our condo.  Charles was very resourceful, putting together a team to spruce up and stage our codo so it would sell for its full potential.  He held multiple open houses and brokerage tours and worked with us to get the highest possible price for our unit.<br/><br/>We couldn't be more happy with Charles Norman, and I hope you give him a chance to represent your real estate needs.

5,"165 Blossom Hill Road San Jose CA, 95123",2024-04-02,"Prior to upgrading to our new home my family of 5 adults were living in a 2-bedroom 2-bath 1,100 square foot 1964 mobile home. The home was incredible small and completely outdated. The walls were made of a Masonite material, the windows offered limited protection from the elements and if we used too many appliances at one time the breakers would constantly fail.  We were referred by our niece (who also upgraded her home) to Alex Ho; we went to Alliance Homes and were met with nothing but smiles and encouragement from the time we entered their offices.  We were introduced to Alexander Ho (our salesmen) and instantly developed a relationship that has continued far beyond the purchase of our home. Alex catered to of every need regarding the purchase and insured that we were completely satisfied throughout the entire process. There were many steps in the process of customizing our home that I never imagined existed, but I was comforted knowing that Alex was both competent and knowledgeable to address all our concerns. Throughout the process we spent countless hours over several days on the phone, in his office and emailing to ensure that every detail was gone over and understood by both he and us. The communication was key because of the many changes that take place as we were making decisions. We were told at the onset that once our old home was removed it would be approximately 10-weeks to complete the process of delivery and setup; we were pleasantly surprised that despite all the rain we had, it only took 8 weeks. When we did the walk through, we were amazed at how all the small details came together so well to create a beautiful home. We are so pleased with every upgrade we chose from the crown molding to the 60-foot awing that completely covers our driveway. We upgraded everything we possibly could just so we could move in without having to do anything.I would tell anyone reading this review; if you can upgrade your home do so and I also highly recommend Alexander Ho as your sales agent and Alliance Manufactured Homes as your dealer.","prior upgrade new home family 5 adult live 2 bedroom 2 bath 1,100 square foot 1964 mobile home home incredible small completely outdated wall masonite material window offer limited protection element appliance time breaker constantly fail refer niece upgrade home alex ho go alliance home meet smile encouragement time enter office introduce alexander ho salesman instantly develop relationship continue far purchase home alex cater need purchase insure completely satisfied entire process step process customize home imagine exist comfort know alex competent knowledgeable address concern process spend countless hour day phone office email ensure detail go understand communication key change place make decision tell onset old home remove approximately 10 week complete process delivery setup pleasantly surprised despite rain take 8 week walk amazed small detail come create beautiful home pleased upgrade choose crown molding 60 foot awing completely cover driveway upgrade possibly have tell read review upgrade home highly recommend alexander ho sale agent alliance manufacture home dealer",POSITIVE,0.777845025062561,,,,

My wife and I were first-time home buyers in our 40s and knew nothing about the process. Frankly, part of why it took us so long is because we were intimidated by the process. Gabriela came very highly recommended by a friend of mine, and what really stuck out to me was how much integrity he felt she had. We saw that in spades! We met Gabriela at her office and she was incredibly warm and knowledgeable. She walked us through the process so expertly. That was December 9. About a week later, she took us on a marathon tour of 8 houses we'd wanted to see in the East Bay. She was so patient and totally willing to let us take as much time to look around and see as many properties as we wanted. She probably spent at least 7 or 8 hours with us that day, and probably would've gone to look at more if we hadn't tapped out. We decided we wanted to submit an offer on a lovely home. She guided us through what offer to make, and her advice was invaluable. She had a feeling about the seller and the seller's agent, and felt that we could get the house for less than the listing price, which freaked us out a little because we've all heard the crazy stories about how much houses in the Bay Area go for. But she held firm, we submitted our bid, and less than two weeks after meeting her, we had our offer on the house accepted! What followed was a whirlwind month of inspections and paperwork and more paperwork, but all of it was masterfully shepherded along by Gabriela, WHILE SHE WAS ON A PRE-PLANNED HOLIDAY CRUISE VACATION IN BARBADOS WITH HER IN-LAWS!!! She also got us appraisal and inspection contingencies - unheard of these days - and negotiated a substantial credit on our closing costs. She's simply amazing. We finally closed on the house and got the keys yesterday, and she came and had pastries and a toast at the house with us. She even brought our daughter a little sheepskin blanket she'd liked on our house tour in another home, and champagne and champagne glasses! We wish she were part of the family!

5,"4384 Gresham Dr El Dorado Hills, CA 95762",2023-04-19,"We met Leah over two years ago when our curiosity serendipitously led us to beautiful faraway lands of Granite Bay & El Dorado Hills. A journey that started just before the pandemic, survived the fluctuating markets during the pandemic to yield one of the most happiest moments of our life, all thanks to Leah. She has been a true champion for our family through the various milestones and remains a trusted friend to this day. What struck me the most about her was how genuine and thorough Leah can be. I can confidently say that Leah are one of the most dedicated and hardworking real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with … ever! And we have worked with many! After living in the SF Bay Area for the past 22+ years, we were ready for a change of scene as we settle down for the “empty nest” phase of our lives. We explored every potential residential market in and around the SF Bay Area, stretching from Carmel/Monterrey to Half Moon Bay and then all the way up north to the Greater Sacramento area, Very few of the agents we collaborated with were as invested in the process as Leah. It always seemed as though they had other priorities ahead of us and/or competing agendas that didn’t quite reflect our best interest. The raging housing market has definitely brought many thrill seekers to the real estate market; folks we didn’t quite identify with. Lean on the other hand has the unique ability to juggle multiple tasks while maintaining the highest quality in her work. Her professionalism and work ethic are unparalleled, and she consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that every little detail (even the casual remarks made in the moment) are appropriately addressed and completed as expected, to the highest standard. I like to say that she values us so much that she only engages the best in the industry. She efficiently led us through the home inspections, the challenging follow-ups with the Seller and finally saw us through to the finish line. She was so happy for us when we finally closed. Only a friend or someone who genuinely cares could cheer the way she does for our future in this home. I have learnt so much from Leah through this process; most importantly her remarkably positive outlook in any situation and her exceptionally mindful communication skills. We had an especially difficult buying experience and we could not have done this without her advice and guidance. We highly recommend Leah to any homeowner looking to sell or a buyer looking to buy.
