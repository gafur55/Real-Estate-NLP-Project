Not only did she really ground us during this crazy process, she was such a fun cheerleader, therapist, partner and friend.  I would highly recommend Katelyn for anyone that wants to work with a kick butt agent.  She is amazing and can't say enough about her.   \n",

With us having little prior knowledge and all the questions in the world; Beverly was patient, kind, helpful, understanding, just overall amazing throughout the whole process. Between recommendations for inspections and close contact with everyone involved so she could reach out to other vendors and help us along the way, Beverly was there day or night to give insight or simplify things on our end. We love our new home and I would strongly recommend Beverly to anyone I know buying a house! She made this experience stress free and we felt we were in good hands from start to finish. Thank you for everything Bev!!   \n",

When I approached her about a purchase in Rancho Mission Viejo or surrounding areas..  She immediately did a search and eliminated all the properties that would not be a fit.  The problem was the properties she presented were all great and would work for me!  After finally picking the property that I wanted, Kim took over and presented the offer and dealt with the selling agent.  She would give me regular updates and reach out to me when she needed a decision from me.  All and all, working with Kim has been nothing less than a 5 star experience.  I would highly recommend her.   \n",

I have my license and have experience selling homes in another market, but was unfamiliar with the LA area. He helped us to go over areas that would work for what we were looking for. We ended up changing our requirements and then quickly finding something within a week or two of looking in a new area. We had a challenging escrow due to administrative delays, but Aaron was there to keep us updated and keep things moving along as much as possible. He is competent and laid back - just what you need when going through a stressful situation!   \n",
