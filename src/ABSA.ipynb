       "      <td>We met Leah over two years ago when our curiosity serendipitously led us to beautiful faraway lands of Granite Bay &amp; El Dorado Hills. A journey that started just before the pandemic, survived the fluctuating markets during the pandemic to yield one of the most happiest moments of our life, all thanks to Leah. She has been a true champion for our family through the various milestones and remains a trusted friend to this day. What struck me the most about her was how genuine and thorough Leah can be. I can confidently say that Leah are one of the most dedicated and hardworking real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with … ever! And we have worked with many! After living in the SF Bay Area for the past 22+ years, we were ready for a change of scene as we settle down for the “empty nest” phase of our lives. We explored every potential residential market in and around the SF Bay Area, stretching from Carmel/Monterrey to Half Moon Bay and then all the way up north to the Greater Sacramento area, Very few of the agents we collaborated with were as invested in the process as Leah. It always seemed as though they had other priorities ahead of us and/or competing agendas that didn’t quite reflect our best interest. The raging housing market has definitely brought many thrill seekers to the real estate market; folks we didn’t quite identify with. Lean on the other hand has the unique ability to juggle multiple tasks while maintaining the highest quality in her work. Her professionalism and work ethic are unparalleled, and she consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that every little detail (even the casual remarks made in the moment) are appropriately addressed and completed as expected, to the highest standard. I like to say that she values us so much that she only engages the best in the industry. She efficiently led us through the home inspections, the challenging follow-ups with the Seller and finally saw us through to the finish line. She was so happy for us when we finally closed. Only a friend or someone who genuinely cares could cheer the way she does for our future in this home. I have learnt so much from Leah through this process; most importantly her remarkably positive outlook in any situation and her exceptionally mindful communication skills. We had an especially difficult buying experience and we could not have done this without her advice and guidance. We highly recommend Leah to any homeowner looking to sell or a buyer looking to buy. She is simply THE best!</td>\n",

I do not feel like she represents me. All she represent is herself who wants a quick commission without adequate effort. Her knowledge, expertise, negotiation skills are so poor. There was a property line dispute but she told me no any problem in that property. After escrow was closed and the neighbor approached me and we found out. But even at that point, she just wanted to protect herself without providing any help to us. She never felt any sorry. Instead she pointed the finger to me and said I should review documents or contact the related persons by myself. In fact, I spent lots of hours to work on the problem. I do not know since I did anything, why I needed her at the beginning. I won't recommend anybody to her.   \n",

He didn't have any insight into the market and the offer that he directed us to put on the property that we were interested in was 25 K above what the property eventually sold for. He cut down on contingency terms and also was not able to negotiate after inspection was done. He just didn't care and wanted to close a deal. Never work with him.   \n",

Unfortunately, when I hired her to help me buy my first home, she did not competently represent me by failing to relay information, forgetting to have me sign forms and not following my ask to request a seller credit for structural issues uncovered in the inspection. Great attitude and spirit but unfortunately not the Calibur of agent a first time buyer needs to help navigate a very complex and overwhelming process successfully.   \n",

Against our better judgment we allowed her to represent us, as well as the seller. She was unprofessional and dishonest in the handling of our transaction. She insisted that she was \"doing everything she could\" to \"make it work.\" The transaction (thankfully) did not go through, as we would have likely been severely further prejudiced by having Natalie represent us. Thankfully we found an honest and amazing agent to work with after this terrible experience!   \n",

As first time home buyers we felt neglected and uncared for. She was always too busy with other clients. Difficult to contact and took days to respond back even though when we first met she promised she would be available anytime. It's unfortunate she got a commission from our home purchase. It's pathetic that we got the keys to our first home from the lock box!!! Didn't make an effort to make this a memorable experience for us. Never saw or heard from her again. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND HER OR DO BUSINESS WITH HER AGAIN.   \n",

He genuinely wanted us to find a home that was the best for my family and didn't rush us to make a purchase. He's a good listener and took note of everything we were looking for in a home and as a result, we are living in our new house - excellent price, great neighborhood and superb condition.   \n",

She was very personable and accommodating to my schedule even responding to my crazy emails at midnight to early mornings. Her upbeat attitude is inspirational. She understood our every need and thoroughly explained MLS to us to ensure that we purchased the perfect home. Even after escrow, Cathy continues to answer my questions and concerns. I really appreciate all of her efforts and hard work. Thank you so much Cathy!   \n",

       "2999  We met Leah over two years ago when our curiosity serendipitously led us to beautiful faraway lands of Granite Bay & El Dorado Hills. A journey that started just before the pandemic, survived the fluctuating markets during the pandemic to yield one of the most happiest moments of our life, all thanks to Leah. She has been a true champion for our family through the various milestones and remains a trusted friend to this day. What struck me the most about her was how genuine and thorough Leah can be. I can confidently say that Leah are one of the most dedicated and hardworking real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with … ever! And we have worked with many! After living in the SF Bay Area for the past 22+ years, we were ready for a change of scene as we settle down for the “empty nest” phase of our lives. We explored every potential residential market in and around the SF Bay Area, stretching from Carmel/Monterrey to Half Moon Bay and then all the way up north to the Greater Sacramento area, Very few of the agents we collaborated with were as invested in the process as Leah. It always seemed as though they had other priorities ahead of us and/or competing agendas that didn’t quite reflect our best interest. The raging housing market has definitely brought many thrill seekers to the real estate market; folks we didn’t quite identify with. Lean on the other hand has the unique ability to juggle multiple tasks while maintaining the highest quality in her work. Her professionalism and work ethic are unparalleled, and she consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that every little detail (even the casual remarks made in the moment) are appropriately addressed and completed as expected, to the highest standard. I like to say that she values us so much that she only engages the best in the industry. She efficiently led us through the home inspections, the challenging follow-ups with the Seller and finally saw us through to the finish line. She was so happy for us when we finally closed. Only a friend or someone who genuinely cares could cheer the way she does for our future in this home. I have learnt so much from Leah through this process; most importantly her remarkably positive outlook in any situation and her exceptionally mindful communication skills. We had an especially difficult buying experience and we could not have done this without her advice and guidance. We highly recommend Leah to any homeowner looking to sell or a buyer looking to buy. She is simply THE best!   \n",

Run, do not walk to Silva Realty! First time home buyers here and we truly feel like we struck gold in Chris and Cori Silva. In the first 2 weeks with their team we FINALLY have our first home! Before we found Silva Realty, we had pretty much lost all hope. For 6 months we had worked with another realtor. We made offer after offer; 50 in total to no avail. We would go to great lengths - even bidding over the winning offer and continually came up short. Week after week, month after month, it was beginning to be unbearable. Enter Chris and Cori at Silva Realty. They renewed our faith, took great care of us and closed our deal! They were transparent, communicative, and caring. They were more than expected or like anything we had ever experienced. They have been nothing short of amazing. Dream team is putting it lightly. Thank you Chris and Cori for everything! You have changed our lives!   \n",

       "      <td>We met Leah over two years ago when our curiosity serendipitously led us to beautiful faraway lands of Granite Bay &amp; El Dorado Hills. A journey that started just before the pandemic, survived the fluctuating markets during the pandemic to yield one of the most happiest moments of our life, all thanks to Leah. She has been a true champion for our family through the various milestones and remains a trusted friend to this day. What struck me the most about her was how genuine and thorough Leah can be. I can confidently say that Leah are one of the most dedicated and hardworking real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with … ever! And we have worked with many! After living in the SF Bay Area for the past 22+ years, we were ready for a change of scene as we settle down for the “empty nest” phase of our lives. We explored every potential residential market in and around the SF Bay Area, stretching from Carmel/Monterrey to Half Moon Bay and then all the way up north to the Greater Sacramento area, Very few of the agents we collaborated with were as invested in the process as Leah. It always seemed as though they had other priorities ahead of us and/or competing agendas that didn’t quite reflect our best interest. The raging housing market has definitely brought many thrill seekers to the real estate market; folks we didn’t quite identify with. Lean on the other hand has the unique ability to juggle multiple tasks while maintaining the highest quality in her work. Her professionalism and work ethic are unparalleled, and she consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that every little detail (even the casual remarks made in the moment) are appropriately addressed and completed as expected, to the highest standard. I like to say that she values us so much that she only engages the best in the industry. She efficiently led us through the home inspections, the challenging follow-ups with the Seller and finally saw us through to the finish line. She was so happy for us when we finally closed. Only a friend or someone who genuinely cares could cheer the way she does for our future in this home. I have learnt so much from Leah through this process; most importantly her remarkably positive outlook in any situation and her exceptionally mindful communication skills. We had an especially difficult buying experience and we could not have done this without her advice and guidance. We highly recommend Leah to any homeowner looking to sell or a buyer looking to buy.

       "      <td>What a Godsend! Run, do not walk to Silva Realty! First time home buyers here and we truly feel like we struck gold in Chris and Cori Silva. In the first 2 weeks with their team we FINALLY have our first home! Before we found Silva Realty, we had pretty much lost all hope. For 6 months we had worked with another realtor. We made offer after offer; 50 in total to no avail. We would go to great lengths - even bidding over the winning offer and continually came up short. Week after week, month after month, it was beginning to be unbearable. Enter Chris and Cori at Silva Realty. They renewed our faith, took great care of us and closed our deal! They were transparent, communicative, and caring. They were more than expected or like anything we had ever experienced. They have been nothing short of amazing. Dream team is putting it lightly. Thank you Chris and Cori for everything! You have changed our lives!</td>\n",

I do not feel like she represents me. All she represent is herself who wants a quick commission without adequate effort. Her knowledge, expertise, negotiation skills are so poor. There was a property line dispute but she told me no any problem in that property. After escrow was closed and the neighbor approached me and we found out. But even at that point, she just wanted to protect herself without providing any help to us. She never felt any sorry. Instead she pointed the finger to me and said I should review documents or contact the related persons by myself. In fact, I spent lots of hours to work on the problem. I do not know since I did anything, why I needed her at the beginning. I won't recommend anybody to her.   \n",

He didn't have any insight into the market and the offer that he directed us to put on the property that we were interested in was 25 K above what the property eventually sold for. He cut down on contingency terms and also was not able to negotiate after inspection was done. He just didn't care and wanted to close a deal. Never work with him.   \n",

Unfortunately, when I hired her to help me buy my first home, she did not competently represent me by failing to relay information, forgetting to have me sign forms and not following my ask to request a seller credit for structural issues uncovered in the inspection. Great attitude and spirit but unfortunately not the Calibur of agent a first time buyer needs to help navigate a very complex and overwhelming process successfully.   \n",

Against our better judgment we allowed her to represent us, as well as the seller. She was unprofessional and dishonest in the handling of our transaction. She insisted that she was \"doing everything she could\" to \"make it work.\" The transaction (thankfully) did not go through, as we would have likely been severely further prejudiced by having Natalie represent us. Thankfully we found an honest and amazing agent to work with after this terrible experience!   \n",

As first time home buyers we felt neglected and uncared for. She was always too busy with other clients. Difficult to contact and took days to respond back even though when we first met she promised she would be available anytime. It's unfortunate she got a commission from our home purchase. It's pathetic that we got the keys to our first home from the lock box!!! Didn't make an effort to make this a memorable experience for us. Never saw or heard from her again. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND HER OR DO BUSINESS WITH HER AGAIN.   \n",

He genuinely wanted us to find a home that was the best for my family and didn't rush us to make a purchase. He's a good listener and took note of everything we were looking for in a home and as a result, we are living in our new house - excellent price, great neighborhood and superb condition.   \n",

She was very personable and accommodating to my schedule even responding to my crazy emails at midnight to early mornings. Her upbeat attitude is inspirational. She understood our every need and thoroughly explained MLS to us to ensure that we purchased the perfect home. Even after escrow, Cathy continues to answer my questions and concerns. I really appreciate all of her efforts and hard work. Thank you so much Cathy!   \n",

       "2999  We met Leah over two years ago when our curiosity serendipitously led us to beautiful faraway lands of Granite Bay & El Dorado Hills. A journey that started just before the pandemic, survived the fluctuating markets during the pandemic to yield one of the most happiest moments of our life, all thanks to Leah. She has been a true champion for our family through the various milestones and remains a trusted friend to this day. What struck me the most about her was how genuine and thorough Leah can be. I can confidently say that Leah are one of the most dedicated and hardworking real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with … ever! And we have worked with many! After living in the SF Bay Area for the past 22+ years, we were ready for a change of scene as we settle down for the “empty nest” phase of our lives. We explored every potential residential market in and around the SF Bay Area, stretching from Carmel/Monterrey to Half Moon Bay and then all the way up north to the Greater Sacramento area, Very few of the agents we collaborated with were as invested in the process as Leah. It always seemed as though they had other priorities ahead of us and/or competing agendas that didn’t quite reflect our best interest. The raging housing market has definitely brought many thrill seekers to the real estate market; folks we didn’t quite identify with. Lean on the other hand has the unique ability to juggle multiple tasks while maintaining the highest quality in her work. Her professionalism and work ethic are unparalleled, and she consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that every little detail (even the casual remarks made in the moment) are appropriately addressed and completed as expected, to the highest standard. I like to say that she values us so much that she only engages the best in the industry. She efficiently led us through the home inspections, the challenging follow-ups with the Seller and finally saw us through to the finish line. She was so happy for us when we finally closed. Only a friend or someone who genuinely cares could cheer the way she does for our future in this home. I have learnt so much from Leah through this process; most importantly her remarkably positive outlook in any situation and her exceptionally mindful communication skills. We had an especially difficult buying experience and we could not have done this without her advice and guidance. We highly recommend Leah to any homeowner looking to sell or a buyer looking to buy. She is simply THE best!   \n",

Run, do not walk to Silva Realty! First time home buyers here and we truly feel like we struck gold in Chris and Cori Silva. In the first 2 weeks with their team we FINALLY have our first home! Before we found Silva Realty, we had pretty much lost all hope. For 6 months we had worked with another realtor. We made offer after offer; 50 in total to no avail. We would go to great lengths - even bidding over the winning offer and continually came up short. Week after week, month after month, it was beginning to be unbearable. Enter Chris and Cori at Silva Realty. They renewed our faith, took great care of us and closed our deal! They were transparent, communicative, and caring. They were more than expected or like anything we had ever experienced. They have been nothing short of amazing. Dream team is putting it lightly. Thank you Chris and Cori for everything!

       "      <td>We met Leah over two years ago when our curiosity serendipitously led us to beautiful faraway lands of Granite Bay &amp; El Dorado Hills. A journey that started just before the pandemic, survived the fluctuating markets during the pandemic to yield one of the most happiest moments of our life, all thanks to Leah. She has been a true champion for our family through the various milestones and remains a trusted friend to this day. What struck me the most about her was how genuine and thorough Leah can be. I can confidently say that Leah are one of the most dedicated and hardworking real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with … ever! And we have worked with many! After living in the SF Bay Area for the past 22+ years, we were ready for a change of scene as we settle down for the “empty nest” phase of our lives. We explored every potential residential market in and around the SF Bay Area, stretching from Carmel/Monterrey to Half Moon Bay and then all the way up north to the Greater Sacramento area, Very few of the agents we collaborated with were as invested in the process as Leah. It always seemed as though they had other priorities ahead of us and/or competing agendas that didn’t quite reflect our best interest. The raging housing market has definitely brought many thrill seekers to the real estate market; folks we didn’t quite identify with. Lean on the other hand has the unique ability to juggle multiple tasks while maintaining the highest quality in her work. Her professionalism and work ethic are unparalleled, and she consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that every little detail (even the casual remarks made in the moment) are appropriately addressed and completed as expected, to the highest standard. I like to say that she values us so much that she only engages the best in the industry. She efficiently led us through the home inspections, the challenging follow-ups with the Seller and finally saw us through to the finish line. She was so happy for us when we finally closed. Only a friend or someone who genuinely cares could cheer the way she does for our future in this home. I have learnt so much from Leah through this process; most importantly her remarkably positive outlook in any situation and her exceptionally mindful communication skills. We had an especially difficult buying experience and we could not have done this without her advice and guidance. We highly recommend Leah to any homeowner looking to sell or a buyer looking to buy. She is simply THE best!</td>\n",

I do not feel like she represents me. All she represent is herself who wants a quick commission without adequate effort. Her knowledge, expertise, negotiation skills are so poor. There was a property line dispute but she told me no any problem in that property. After escrow was closed and the neighbor approached me and we found out. But even at that point, she just wanted to protect herself without providing any help to us. She never felt any sorry. Instead she pointed the finger to me and said I should review documents or contact the related persons by myself. In fact, I spent lots of hours to work on the problem. I do not know since I did anything, why I needed her at the beginning. I won't recommend anybody to her.   \n",

He didn't have any insight into the market and the offer that he directed us to put on the property that we were interested in was 25 K above what the property eventually sold for. He cut down on contingency terms and also was not able to negotiate after inspection was done. He just didn't care and wanted to close a deal. Never work with him.   \n",

Unfortunately, when I hired her to help me buy my first home, she did not competently represent me by failing to relay information, forgetting to have me sign forms and not following my ask to request a seller credit for structural issues uncovered in the inspection. Great attitude and spirit but unfortunately not the Calibur of agent a first time buyer needs to help navigate a very complex and overwhelming process successfully.   \n",

Against our better judgment we allowed her to represent us, as well as the seller. She was unprofessional and dishonest in the handling of our transaction. She insisted that she was \"doing everything she could\" to \"make it work.\" The transaction (thankfully) did not go through, as we would have likely been severely further prejudiced by having Natalie represent us. Thankfully we found an honest and amazing agent to work with after this terrible experience!   \n",

As first time home buyers we felt neglected and uncared for. She was always too busy with other clients. Difficult to contact and took days to respond back even though when we first met she promised she would be available anytime. It's unfortunate she got a commission from our home purchase. It's pathetic that we got the keys to our first home from the lock box!!! Didn't make an effort to make this a memorable experience for us. Never saw or heard from her again. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND HER OR DO BUSINESS WITH HER AGAIN.   \n",

He genuinely wanted us to find a home that was the best for my family and didn't rush us to make a purchase. He's a good listener and took note of everything we were looking for in a home and as a result, we are living in our new house - excellent price, great neighborhood and superb condition.   \n",

She was very personable and accommodating to my schedule even responding to my crazy emails at midnight to early mornings. Her upbeat attitude is inspirational. She understood our every need and thoroughly explained MLS to us to ensure that we purchased the perfect home. Even after escrow, Cathy continues to answer my questions and concerns. I really appreciate all of her efforts and hard work. Thank you so much Cathy!   \n",

       "2999  We met Leah over two years ago when our curiosity serendipitously led us to beautiful faraway lands of Granite Bay & El Dorado Hills. A journey that started just before the pandemic, survived the fluctuating markets during the pandemic to yield one of the most happiest moments of our life, all thanks to Leah. She has been a true champion for our family through the various milestones and remains a trusted friend to this day. What struck me the most about her was how genuine and thorough Leah can be. I can confidently say that Leah are one of the most dedicated and hardworking real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with … ever! And we have worked with many! After living in the SF Bay Area for the past 22+ years, we were ready for a change of scene as we settle down for the “empty nest” phase of our lives. We explored every potential residential market in and around the SF Bay Area, stretching from Carmel/Monterrey to Half Moon Bay and then all the way up north to the Greater Sacramento area, Very few of the agents we collaborated with were as invested in the process as Leah. It always seemed as though they had other priorities ahead of us and/or competing agendas that didn’t quite reflect our best interest. The raging housing market has definitely brought many thrill seekers to the real estate market; folks we didn’t quite identify with. Lean on the other hand has the unique ability to juggle multiple tasks while maintaining the highest quality in her work. Her professionalism and work ethic are unparalleled, and she consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that every little detail (even the casual remarks made in the moment) are appropriately addressed and completed as expected, to the highest standard. I like to say that she values us so much that she only engages the best in the industry. She efficiently led us through the home inspections, the challenging follow-ups with the Seller and finally saw us through to the finish line. She was so happy for us when we finally closed. Only a friend or someone who genuinely cares could cheer the way she does for our future in this home. I have learnt so much from Leah through this process; most importantly her remarkably positive outlook in any situation and her exceptionally mindful communication skills. We had an especially difficult buying experience and we could not have done this without her advice and guidance. We highly recommend Leah to any homeowner looking to sell or a buyer looking to buy. She is simply THE best!   \n",

Run, do not walk to Silva Realty! First time home buyers here and we truly feel like we struck gold in Chris and Cori Silva. In the first 2 weeks with their team we FINALLY have our first home! Before we found Silva Realty, we had pretty much lost all hope. For 6 months we had worked with another realtor. We made offer after offer; 50 in total to no avail. We would go to great lengths - even bidding over the winning offer and continually came up short. Week after week, month after month, it was beginning to be unbearable. Enter Chris and Cori at Silva Realty. They renewed our faith, took great care of us and closed our deal! They were transparent, communicative, and caring. They were more than expected or like anything we had ever experienced. They have been nothing short of amazing. Dream team is putting it lightly. Thank you Chris and Cori for everything! You have changed our lives!   \n",
